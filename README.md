Aloha Editor License
====================

Aloha Editor is meant to be of benefit to both free open source as well as commercial software developers. It should be able to sustain continous development by itself and thus help all stakeholders profiting from the developments to come.Therefore we adopted a dual licensing approach for Aloha Editor.

##Opensource License.

The Open Source version of this great software is released under the terms of AGPLv3 License.
 
##Commercial License.

If you are a commercial software developer and you want to release your software under a different license than AGPLv3, you may purchase commercial licenses from Gentics Software GmbH. By purchasing commercial licenses we offer you the freedom to choose different ways of licensing and get professional support from our core developers. Contact us for more information!
